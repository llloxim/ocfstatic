# OCF Static

A new website for the OCF. Written in React with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), uses [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

## Development

### Dependencies

- Node.js 18+ (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- If using an Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2, etc.), `vips` is required (can be installed through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) `brew install libvips`)
- If using Windows, WSL is required (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

### Getting set up

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ocf/ocfstatic.git && cd ocfstatic
# Install all of our dependencies
$ corepack enable
$ yarn
# Run dev server (visit http://localhost:8000 to view)
$ yarn develop
```

### Extras

```bash
# Build
$ yarn build
# Lint
$ yarn lint
# Typecheck
$ yarn typecheck
# Autoformat
$ yarn format
```

### Developing with ocfapi locally

Create a file named .env.development with the following contents:

```
GATSBY_API_URL=http://localhost:8001 # or whatever port the API is on
```

This will redirect all API requests to that URL, if you want to revert to the production API just delete the file or comment out the line.

## How to contribute

Take a look at the issues, and take your pick!

## Possible pitfalls

Remember, you are writing server side rendered code. Don't use browser APIs such as anything on `window` except in a `useEffect` hook (and chances are, if you find yourself reaching for those APIs there's a better way of doing it!)
